CSP Troubleshooting Checklist:

1. Open your app in the browser.
2. Open DevTools (F12), go to the Network tab.
3. Click on the main HTML file (index.html) in the list of requests.
4. In the Response Headers, look for 'Content-Security-Policy'.
5. If you see `default-src 'none'`, this is NOT from your Express server. Possible causes:
   - A browser extension is injecting a restrictive CSP.
   - A proxy, VPN, or reverse proxy is adding a CSP header.
   - Your server is not setting the header (or it's being overwritten).
6. Disable all browser extensions and reload the page.
7. Try in a private/incognito window with all extensions disabled.
8. If the problem persists, try a different browser or device.
9. If you have a proxy or VPN, disable it and try again.
10. If you are running behind nginx/Apache, check their configs for CSP headers.

If you see your intended CSP (with 'self', 'unsafe-inline', etc.), the problem should be resolved.
